In order to run a "ToDoAppWithMySql" it is required to have ```docker``` installed. After that, You'll have to run:

```
docker compose -f <pathToFile>/docker-compose-mysql.yml up
```

After that, the connection can be established. The program at this point doesn't do anything other than connecting to the database.
